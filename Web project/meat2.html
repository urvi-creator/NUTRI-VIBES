            <p>To make lemon garlic chicken and green beans, you'll need:</p>

                <li>1 pound fresh green beans, trimmed</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>1 lemon, juiced and zested</li>

                <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the minced garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, lemon zest, dried thyme, salt, and pepper to make the marinade.</li>

                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the green beans are tender.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven and let rest for a few minutes before serving.</li>
                <li>Garnish with fresh chopped parsley, if desired.</li>
